          <li>Are you made of copper and tellurium? Because you're CuTe.</li>
          <li>Do you have 11 protons? Cause you're sodium fine.</li>
          <li>Your body must be made of oxygen and neon because you are the ONe</li>
          <li>Scientists have recently discovered a rare new element called Beautium. It looks like you are made of it.</li>
          <li>Are you made of beryllium, gold, and titanium? You must be because you are BeAuTi-ful.</li>
          <li>I wish I was your derivative so I could lie tangent to your curves. </li>
          <li>My love for you is like pi... never ending.</li>
          <li>I'm not being obtuse, but you're acute girl. </li>
          <li>I don't know if you're in my range, but I'd sure like to take you back to my domain.</li>
          <li>I'm learning about important dates in history. Wanna be one of them?</li>
          <li>Your beauty could launch a thousand ships</li>
          <li>If you were President, you'd be Babe-raham Lincoln.</li>
          <li>You must be the eighth wonder of the world!</li>
          <li>Did it hurt when you fell from the Alps? Because you're an angel! Or I'm dizzy from altitude sickness. Either way.</li>
          <li>You spin my heart like a globe.</li>
